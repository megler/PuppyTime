Live Video with Shelter Pets

An app that allows you to video chat with shelter pets and give them treats.  This socializes dogs who are scared in shelter kennels, gives them better exposure to the public, and raises their chances for adoption.  The application also provides users a way to donate to participating shelters and submit adoption applications.
